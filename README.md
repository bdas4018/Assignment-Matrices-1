# Assignment Matrices -
 
## Contains the following three sets of matrices :
A. Supposed to --- Fixed : C.N = 1000 and Sparsity = 16%.      
                   Vary : sizes = 3000x3000, 1024x 1024, 128x128 - (3 matrices). 
   Instead took ---- For C.N instead of 1000, took the order 10^4 - 38093, , 10175, 9436.

B. Fixed : Size = 512x512 and Sparsity = 18%.  
   Vary : C.N = 100 (2944 instead), 10000 (9157), 1000000 (928109) - (3 matrices). 

C. Fixed : Size = 128x128 and C.N = 10000.     
   Vary : Sparsity = 16% (9789), 30% (9193), 45% (9439) -(3 matrices).
